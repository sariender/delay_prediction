# Final Assignment: Robust Journey Planning

This section provides a brief overview of the final assignment, including the minimum information needed to place the first assignment in context.

Additional details, including submission instructions, will be provided in the final assignment.

**Executive summary**: Build a robust SBB journey planner and present it in a short (7min max) video presentation.

This will be completed as a team project and will be due at the end of this course.

- Video due date: May 27th before midnight.
- Project due date: May 29th before midnight (push your work on gitlab).
- Oral: Select a time slot for your group on Moodle for the Q&A session, or contact us if you have conflicts.

## Problem Motivation

Imagine you are a regular user of the public transport system, and you are checking the operator's schedule to meet your friends for a class reunion.
The choices are:

1. You could leave in 10mins, and arrive with enough time to spare for gossips before the reunion starts.

2. You could leave now on a different route and arrive just in time for the reunion.

Undoubtedly, if this is the only information available, most of us will opt for option 1.

If we now tell you that option 1 carries a fifty percent chance of missing a connection and be late for the reunion. Whereas, option 2 is almost guaranteed to take you there on time. Would you still consider option 1?

Probably not. However, most public transport applications will insist on the first option. This is because they are programmed to plan routes that offer the shortest travel times, without considering the risk factors.

----
## Problem Description

In this final project you will build your own _robust_ public transport route planner to improve on that. You will reuse the SBB dataset (See next section: [Dataset Description](#Dataset-Description)).

Given a desired **day of week**, **arrival time**, and **confidence level** _Q%_, your route planner will compute the fastest route between given departure and arrival stops such that the probability of arriving on time is at least _Q%_.
For instance: "what is the fastest route from A to B such that I arrive before time T with probability at least _Q%_?"
Note that confidence _Q%_ is the probability that a route can be completed within the planned travel time.

You must provide a method to initialize the route planner with a list of region (shape) UUIDs from the _iceberg.com490_iceberg.geo_ table.

The output of the algorithm is a list of routes between _A_ and _B_ and their confidence levels. The routes must be sorted from latest departure (fastest route) to earliest departure (longest route) time at _A_, they must all arrive at _B_ before _T_ with a confidence level greater than or equal to _Q_. Ideally, it should be possible to visualize the routes on a map.

In order to answer this question you will need to:

- Model the public transport infrastructure for your route planning algorithm using the data provided to you.
- Build a predictive model using the historical arrival/departure time data, you may add external sources of data (e.g. weather data).
- Implement a robust route planning algorithm using this predictive model.
- Test and **validate** your results. Note that we will put a particular emphasis on the scientific validation of your method.
- Implement a simple Jupyter-based visualization to demonstrate your method, using Jupyter widgets such as [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html).

Solving this problem accurately can be difficult. You are allowed a few **simplifying assumptions**:

- We only consider journeys at reasonable hours of the day, and assuming a recent schedule.
- We allow short walking distances for transfers between two stops, and assume a walking speed of _50 m/min_ on a straight line "As the Crow Flies", i.e. regardless of obstacles, human-built or natural, such as building, highways, rivers, or lakes.
- The total walking distance over the full trip should not exceed a maximum (default 500m, you can make it configurable). 
- In the assessment, we will only consider journeys that start and end on known station coordinates (train station, bus stops, etc.), never from a random location. However, walking from the departure stop to a nearby stop (or nearby stop to arrival stop) is allowed as long as the total walking distance is within the maximum.
- We only consider stops in an area that will be specified at a later time (the _uuid_ of [Geo spatial data](#Geo-spatial-data) should be configurable).
- If necessary, stops within the specified area can be reached through transfers at stops located outside the area. However, you do not need to determine the optimal set of external stops that minimizes travel time between stops within the area of interest.
- There is no penalty for assuming that delays or travel times on the public transport network are uncorrelated with one another.
- Once a route is computed, a traveller is expected to follow the planned routes to the end, or until it fails (i.e. miss a connection).
  You **do not** need to address the case where travellers are able to defer their decisions and adapt their journey "en route", as more information becomes available. This would require us to consider all alternative routes (contingency plans) in the computation of the uncertainty levels, which is more difficult to implement.
- The planner does not need to account for the inconvenience to the traveler in the event of a plan failure. Two routes with the same travel time, within the specified uncertainty tolerance, are considered equivalent, even if the consequences of one route failing are significantly worse for the traveler (e.g., being stranded overnight), while the other route's failure would result in a less severe outcome.
- All other things being equal, you will prefer routes with the minimum walking distance and minimum number of transfers.
- You do not need to optimize the computation time of your method, as long as the run-time is reasonable.
- When computing a path you may pick the timetable of a recent week and assume that it is unchanged.

Upon request, and with clear instructions from you, we can help prepare additional data in a form that is easier for you to process (within the limits of our ability, and time availability). In which case the data will be accessible to all.

## Grading Method

After reviewing your videos, we will organize short Q&A discussions of 10 minutes per group. These discussions will be scheduled on the last week - actual day and times to be discussed on a case by case basis.

Think of yourselves as a startup trying to sell your solution to the board of a public transport company who has a good grasp of the state of the art. Your video is your elevator pitch. It must be short and convincing. In it you describe the viability
of the following aspects:

1. Data and data transformations used by your method
1. Method used to model the public transport network
1. Method used to create the predictive models
1. Route planning algorithm
1. Validation method

Your final grade will be based on the video presentation, the Q&A session, and the implementation, taking into account:

1. Clarity and conciseness of the video presentation, code, and answers during the Q&A
1. Teamwork, including how the problem is formulated and decomposed into smaller tasks among team members
1. Originality of the solution design, analysis, and presentation
1. Functional quality of the implementation (does it work as intended?)
1. Soundness and correctness of the proposed approach and answers
1. Time performance of your solution (a)

Critical discussion of the strengths, limitations, and potential shortcomings of the proposed solution


(a) The time performance of your solution will be evaluated along two dimensions:
  - Data preparation time: the one-time cost required to prepare the data used by your algorithm (e.g., creating tables, preprocessing, building indexes or intermediate structures).
  - Routing time: the time required by your routing algorithm to compute routes once the data has been prepared.
  - Your performance will be evaluated relative to the class results for both components. Outlier mplementations that are **significantly** slower than the typical range (either in preprocessing time or routing time) may receive lower scores.

**DO NOT** underestimate the importance of your video presentations.

## Dataset Description

For this project we will use the data published on the [Open Data Platform Mobility Switzerland](<https://opentransportdata.swiss/en>).

For grading we will use recent SBB data limited around a city area of our choice (hold out data). We recommend that you develop a solution around Lausanne area and make sure that the solution will be able to work in a different or slightly larger area, and different period. We will select the area using a different region from the [geo shapes table](#Geo-spatial-data). The region _uuid_ from the table should therefore be a well documented parameter of your solution available as variable in the notebook. 

For your convenience, we have defined the table for each of the data set described below in the database _iceberg.com490_iceberg_. You can list the tables with the command _SHOW TABLES IN iceberg.com490_iceberg_.

Figure 1. better illustrates the above concepts relating stops, routes, trips and stop times on a real example (route _11-3-A-j19-1_, direction _0_)

 ![journeys](figs/journeys.svg)
 
 _Figure 1._ Relation between stops, routes, trips and stop times. The vertical axis represents the stops along the route in the direction of travel.
             The horizontal axis represents the time of day on a non-linear scale. Solid lines connecting the stops correspond to trips.
             A trip is one instances of a vehicle journey on the route. Trips on same route do not need
             to mark all the stops on the route, resulting in trips having different stop lists for the same route.

#### Geo spatial data

You will find useful geospatial shapes in the table _iceberg.com490_iceberg.geo_`.

* **geo**:
    * _uuid_: unique identifier of the shape (swiss topo)
    * _name_: a human readable name of the shape
    * _country_: country containing the shape, e.g. _CH_
    * _region_: region or canton, e.g. _VD_
    * _level_: shape class level, e.g. _city_, _canton_, ...
    * _wkb_geometry_: binary (WKB) representation of the shape that can be used in Geospatial UDF functions.

#### Misc data

Other sources of data are available or can be made available on demaind (if reasonable).

**Weather**:

Some had some success using weather data to predict traffic delays.

If you want to give a try, web services such as [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/ch/r%C3%BCmlang/LSZH/date/2022-1-1), can be a good
source of historical weather data. For your convenience we have made available to you a copy of the last few years of weather data reported at various airports in Swizerland.

You can find the data on HDFS under _/data/com-490/iceberg/weather/history/_ and _/data/com-490/json/weather/stations/_.

**Others**:

You are of course free to use any other sources of data of your choice that might find helpful.

You may for instance download regions of openstreetmap [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=9/47.2839/8.1271&layers=TN),
which includes a public transport layer. If the planet OSM is too large for you,
you can find frequently updated exports of the [Swiss OSM region](https://planet.osm.ch/).

## Hints

Before you get started, we offer a few hints:

- Reserve some time to Google-up the state of the art before implementing. There is a substantial amount of work on this topic. Look for *time-dependent*, or *time-varying networks*, and *stochastic route planning under uncertainty*.
- You should already be acquainted with the data.
However, as you learn more about the state of the art, spend time to better understand your data.
Anticipate what can and cannot be done from what is available to you, and plan your design strategy accordingly. Do not hesitate to complete the proposed data sources with your own if necessary.
- Start small with a simple working solution and improve on it.
In a first version, assume that all trains and buses are always sharp on time.
Focus on creating a sane collaborative environment that you can use to develop and test your work in team as it evolves.
Next, work-out the risk-aware solution gradually - start with a simple predictive model and improve it. In addition you can test your algorithm on selected pairs of stops before generalizing to the full public transport network under consideration.

## FAQ

This section will be updated with the Frequently Asked Questions during the course of this project. Please stay tuned.

##### 1 - Q: Do we need to take into account walking times at the connections?
* **A**: Yes, but since we do not have the details of the platforms at each location, we can use a universal formula to come up with a reasonable walking time.
We must also allow time for transfers between different modes of transports, such as from bus to tramways.
You can use the transfer time information available from `transfers.txt` from the [timetables](#Timetable-data).
Otherwise, we assume that `2min` mininum are required for transfers within a same location
(i.e. same lat,lon coordinates), to which you add _1min per 50m_ walking time
to connect two stops that are at most _500m_ appart, on a straight line distance between their two lat,lon. 

##### 2 - Q: Can I take advantage of the fact that a connection departs late most of the time to allow a plan that would otherwise not be possible according to the official schedule.
* **A**: You may discover that you could take advantage of connections that have a high probability of departing late.
However, this is not recommended, or it should come with a warning.
Imagine from a user experience perspective, how would you react if you are being proposed an impossible plan in which a transfer is scheduled to depart before you arrive?
Furthermore, who would you blame if the plan fails: the planner that came up with a theoretically infeasible plan, or the operator who respected their schedule?
